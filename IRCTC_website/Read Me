* In this Project I have Created A Entire IRCTC Console Module.
* It can be put into multiThreaded Environment.
* Here Admin can Create,Read,deleate and update available trains;
and User can book see status of booking,cancel tickets.
* It mostly reflect Object to Object Communications such as,
->If you change the seat retio It will automatically change seats by seat no,birth position,and sitting position.
->If you give the starting time of first stop ,It will automatically allocate the remaining stop timing.
* Im curretly develop an railway routing Interface using graphs and dfs to my project.
* Im using static variable instead of ORM to store data.
* Im currently changed the console module into database Using Hibernate.
* Later the View Part will be changed to GUI(front end).
